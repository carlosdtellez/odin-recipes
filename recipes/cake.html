        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter</li>
        <li>1½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>5⅓ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Use the first set of ingredients to make the cake. In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa,
            baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla, mix for 3 minutes with an electric
            mixer. Stir in the boiling water by hand. Pour evenly into the two prepared pans.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool for 10
            minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            To make the frosting, use the second set of ingredients. Cream butter until light and fluffy. Stir in the
            cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla. Beat to a spreading consistency.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Split the layers of cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them
            onto a serving plate. Frost the outside of the cake.
        </li>
        <p></p>
    </ol>
